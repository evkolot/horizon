    <p>You have this option <b>enabled</b>.</p>
    <p>Now, whenever you want to access your account, you need to provide both your password and a code, which you can get from an authentication mobile app. You can regenerate the key needed for the app here, in case you lost it.</p>
    <input class="btn btn-secondary always-enabled" name="disable" type="submit" value="Disable">
    <input class="btn btn-primary always-enabled" name="new_key" type="submit" value="Get new key">
    {% else %}
    <p>You have this option <b>disabled</b>.</p>
    <p>We highly recommend you enable it, since it provides a higher level of security to access your account.</p>
    <p>If you want to give two factor authentication a try, you need to provide a security question, just in case you happen to lose access to your authentication app.</p>
